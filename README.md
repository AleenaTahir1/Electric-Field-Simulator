  - Click anywhere to place charges
  - Toggle between positive and negative charges
  - Enter precise coordinates for exact positioning
  - Undo last placed charge with a single click

- **Real-time Field Visualization**
  - Dynamic field line rendering
  - Field strength indicators
  - Color-coded charge representation
  - Interactive probe points for field analysis

- **Modern User Interface**
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Responsive design
  - Intuitive controls
  - Clean and professional layout

- **Advanced Controls**
  - Zoom in/out functionality
  - Pan across the field
  - Clear all charges
  - Field strength tooltips

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Python 3.x (for running the local server)

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AleenaTahir1/Electric-Field-Simulator.git
   cd Electric-Field-Simulator
   ```

2. Start the local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## üí° How to Use

1. **Place Charges**
   - Select "Place Charge" mode
   - Choose positive or negative charge
   - Click on the canvas or use coordinate inputs

2. **Analyze Fields**
   - Switch to "Probe Field" mode
   - Click anywhere to place probe points
   - View field strength and direction
   - Hover over canvas for real-time field data

3. **Navigate**
   - Use zoom buttons to adjust view
   - Middle-click and drag to pan
   - Use "Undo" to remove last charge
   - "Clear All" to reset simulation

## üé® User Interface

The simulator features a clean, modern interface with:
- Left sidebar for controls and inputs
- Main canvas for visualization
- Bottom panel for probe point data
- Intuitive button layout and grouping
